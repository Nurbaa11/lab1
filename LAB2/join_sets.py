#Join set1 and set2 into a new set:
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)

#Use | to join two sets:
set11 = {"a", "b", "c"}

set33 = set11 | set22
print(set33)

#There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.

#The union() and update() methods joins all items from both sets.

#The intersection() method keeps ONLY the duplicates.

#The difference() method keeps the items from the first set that are not in the other set(s).

#The symmetric_difference() method keeps all items EXCEPT the duplicates.
